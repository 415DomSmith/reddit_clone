###Reddit Clone

For this assignment you will need to combine your knowledge of models, association, and auth to build a clone of Reddit!

##Requirements

Your site must have the following specs:

* Models - User, Post, and Comment
* Anyone can visit the root page and see a list of all the posts
* Anyone can click on a post to view its comments
* Only a logged in user can submit a new post
* Only a logged in user can comment on a post
* Only the owner/creator of a post can edit that post
* Only the owner/creator of a post can delete that post
* Only the owner/creator of a comment can edit that comment
* Only the owner/creator of a comment can delete that comment

This assignment is meant to build on all the things you've been learning up to this point: authentication, nested routes, model associations, etc.  Use your own experience and judgement to determine what other specs may be necessary to make a reddit clone, for example you decide what properties your model should have.

##Styling

Styling is not a huge component of this project, but feel free to make your site look nice. Add Bootstrap, SemanticUI, or roll your own styling from scratch. Don't stress out about it, though. I want you to focus mainly on the back-end logic.

##Bonus Features

Completely optional, after you finish the basic functionality - add moderators. A moderator can edit or delete any post.
